void main() {
  
  List<Student> students=[Student('surya'),
                         Student('karthi'),
                         Student('muruga'),
                         Student('shiva')];
  
  print(students);

  class Student{
    final String name;
    
    Student(this.name);
    
    @override
    String toString() => 'Student: $name';
}


output:
[Student: surya, Student: karthi, Student: muruga, Student: shiva]

// AS soon as we create a class dart automatically create a toString method and we can access it with the @override as mentioned above.
