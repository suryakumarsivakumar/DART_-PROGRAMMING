//POLYMORPHISM:-  polymorphism helps an object to take different kind of forms for eg., the object cat first assigned to the Cat class and it prints " cat making sound"  and then the same object is assigned to the Dog class and it prints " dog making sound".
// it does this with the help of inheritance and method overriding.
