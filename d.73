output:
hello
helllo wrold!
my name is surya
hey!!!!!


//whenever we have a future(), we can use the then() and it allows us to execute the other statements in our program without waiting for the future ().
// here then is used and all the print statments are executed and after that only the future function with a 2 seconds delay is executed i.e., "hey!!!!".
