void main() async {
  
  print("hello");
  final result = await giveResultAfter2Second();
  
  print(result);
  print("helllo wrold!");
  print("my name is surya");
  
}


Future<String> giveResultAfter2Second(){
  return Future.delayed(Duration(seconds:2),() async{
    return 'hey!!!!!';
  });
  
}

output:
hello
hey!!!!!
helllo wrold!
my name is surya

// here we use the delayed function which delays the output and also we use the duration and we gave 2 seconds for the delay .
// the first print statement will print hello after two seconds only the hey!!!! will get printed.
