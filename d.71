void main() async {
  print(giveResultAfter2Second());
  final result = await giveResultAfter2Second();
  
  print(result);
  print("helllo wrold!");
  print("my name is surya");
  
}


Future<String> giveResultAfter2Second(){
  return Future((){
    return 'hey!!!!!';
  });
  
}

output:
Instance of '_Future<String>'
hey!!!!!
helllo wrold!
my name is surya


//here the async means we are executing all the other statement in our program without waiting for th execution of some statements and their results.
//in the first print statement it prints as "Instance of '_Future<String>'" and from that we know that the future is a class and it used to async the program
//in the void main we use async and in the third line we await which waits until the program executes and gets the output and store it in the result variable.
