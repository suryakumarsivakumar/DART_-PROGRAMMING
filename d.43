// here we created sn instance called car of the datatype Vehicle and of the class car and when we try to access a variable in the car which is not in the vehicle it will show an error.
// So we use "as" keyword and we assigned it to Car class now we can access the noOfWheels variable from the class Car

// similarly we created a variable called somevalue of type dynamic and converted it's type to int using 'as' keyword
