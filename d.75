void main() async {
  
  countDown().listen((val){
    print(val);
  }, onDone: (){
    print("hey i completed it!!!!");
  });
  print("hi");
}


Stream<int> countDown() async*{
  for(int i=5;i>0;i--){
    yield i;
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1));
  }
}

output:
hi
5
4
3
2
1
hey i completed it!!!!

// here first the print statement at last "hi" is printed first because streams is a asynchronous and it executes without waiting for any other thing.
// we also used the onDone() , which basically a function that we can include at last.
